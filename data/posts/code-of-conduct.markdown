# 1. Purpose

GDG Sudbury prides itself on being an open, respectful, and inclusive community. That means jerky behavior isn't allowed at GDG meetings. Because we know that it's not obvious to everyone, here's a reminder of things we don't allow: jokes or offensive comments about sex/sexuality/race/religion/nationality/body size, showing port in public, touching people uninvited, or continuing to interact with someone after they've asked you to stop. Continuous jerky behavior may result in getting expelled from the meeting or GDG Chapter. 

If someone is bothering you, please tell the GDG Organizers or event host and they will take care of it. We want to maintain GDG Sudbury's awesomeness.

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.
